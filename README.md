Andorid Wear Workshop
=====================

This project is an example of how to develop for Android Wear. The example we're using are GitHub Issues. When a new issue is added or reopened a notification will show on the phone and on the Wear.

There are a number of tags which show the project at various stages.

 - `starting` is the tag we will be start from in the workshop. It features basic notifications which will work on the Wear, but not much else.
 - `complete` is the tag which has all the features. It has actions, voice replies and pages.
