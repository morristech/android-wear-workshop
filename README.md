Andorid Wear Workshop
=====================

This project is an example of how to develop for Android Wear. The example we're using are GitHub Issues. When a new issue is added or reopened a notification will show on the phone and on the Wear.

There are a number of tags which show the project at various stages.

 - `0-Starting` is the tag we will be start from in the workshop. It features basic notifications which will work on the Wear, but not much else.
 - `1-Action` In this tag we've added in an action to close the issue. This is not wear specific, but will show on the wear. 
 - `2-Voice-Action` Here we've added in a voice action, where you can shout at your wrist to comment on an issue. 
 - `3-Pages` Finally, we show the last three comments as pages on the wear.
